# Machine Learning Project - October 2024

## Project Overview:
- This project is focused on identifying different aircraft using machine learning techniques to classify the type of aircraft based on image data. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and PyTorch.

## Key Features:
- *Data processing and analysis*: Steps to preprocess, clean, and analyze the data.
- *Model training and evaluation*: Training a model on our dataset from a pretrained ResNet50 model and evaluating its performance.

## Repository Structure:
- *ML_project_dec_1.ipynb*: Main jupyter notebook containing all code, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- *models/*: Folder for saved model weights.
- *results/*: Contains output files.

## Getting Started:
### Prerequisites:
  - This project requires Python 3.8 or later. Install dependencies with the following command:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Project:
  - Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/holdendavis/ML_Project_2024.git
    - cd ML_Project_2024
  - Access dataset using HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceM4/FGVC-Aircraft
   
  - Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open ML_project_dec_1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore and execute each step.
  - Training the Model (Optional): To re-train the model with custom settings, adjust parameters in the notebook and execute the training cells.
